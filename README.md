## 💡 Our Solution

*Project Name:* 
#### FinGeniee - Intent-based Ai suggestion agent. 

We built a conversational AI agent that understands the user's financial intent and suggests (not executes) DeFi strategies optimized for inclusion and safety. When a user asks: “How can I grow $100 for my village savings group?” the bot identifies suitable Ethereum-based protocols—like Aave for lending, Lido for staking, or stablecoin vaults for protection—and recommends the best-fit option.

Unlike generic language models like ChatGPT, FinIntent AI is:
Protocol-aware: Trained on structured DeFi strategy mappings and real-time protocol analytics.
Action-specific: Focused solely on financial suggestion logic, not broad conversational topics.
Risk-sensitive: Designed for communities where bad investments can severely impact livelihoods.
And here's what makes it truly unique:

💥 Volatility Protection Logic Since crypto markets can swing wildly overnight, our system doesn't stop at initial recommendations. If a user follows a suggestion and the associated asset starts crashing beyond a defined threshold, FinIntent AI proactively recommends conversion into stablecoins (e.g., USDC or DAI) to minimize loss. This real-time alert and migration safeguard makes our AI not just smart—but responsibly adaptive.

📈 Impact For rural users, NGOs, and micro-investors, this is like having a DeFi advisor who:

1.Understands intent
2.Knows protocol behavior
3.Protects against risk
4.Easy conversational
We don’t just simplify finance. We democratize it—with trust, clarity, and foresight.
