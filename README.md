## 📌 Problem Statement

We addressed the challenge: *“DeFi + Financial Inclusion Agents”*  
### Problem Statement
We addressed the challenge: “DeFi + Financial Inclusion Agents” Access to decentralized finance (DeFi) remains limited for underserved groups such as rural communities, microfinance recipients, and first-time crypto users. Traditional onboarding often demands significant technical knowledge, while decision-making involves parsing through complex yield strategies, fluctuating gas fees, and unfamiliar risk profiles. For a new user, this avalanche of decentralized jargon, wallets, and protocol choices can be overwhelming—making DeFi feel inaccessible and unsafe. These barriers prevent equitable participation in blockchain-powered financial ecosystems.

Our challenge was to simplify and personalize DeFi strategy discovery—making it intuitive, inclusive, and intent-driven. By shifting from keyword-based queries to AI-powered intent understanding, we aimed to offer users tailored suggestions that feel conversational, relevant, and empowering—rather than technical or intimidating.

## 💡 Our Solution

*Project Name:* 
#### FinGeniee - Intent-based Ai suggestion agent. 

We built a conversational AI agent that understands the user's financial intent and suggests (not executes) DeFi strategies optimized for inclusion and safety. When a user asks: “How can I grow $100 for my village savings group?” the bot identifies suitable Ethereum-based protocols—like Aave for lending, Lido for staking, or stablecoin vaults for protection—and recommends the best-fit option.

Unlike generic language models like ChatGPT, FinIntent AI is:
Protocol-aware: Trained on structured DeFi strategy mappings and real-time protocol analytics.
Action-specific: Focused solely on financial suggestion logic, not broad conversational topics.
Risk-sensitive: Designed for communities where bad investments can severely impact livelihoods.
And here's what makes it truly unique:

💥 Volatility Protection Logic Since crypto markets can swing wildly overnight, our system doesn't stop at initial recommendations. If a user follows a suggestion and the associated asset starts crashing beyond a defined threshold, FinIntent AI proactively recommends conversion into stablecoins (e.g., USDC or DAI) to minimize loss. This real-time alert and migration safeguard makes our AI not just smart—but responsibly adaptive.

📈 Impact For rural users, NGOs, and micro-investors, this is like having a DeFi advisor who:

Understands intent, Knows protocol behavior, Protects against risk, Easy conversational
We don’t just simplify finance. We democratize it—with trust, clarity, and foresight.
